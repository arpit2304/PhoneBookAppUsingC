Data structures  Used:  Structures, Linked List

Modularity (Division of the code into different functions/Modules):
•	Main 
o	 starts the program
o	Read the Content from the File
o	And Display it.
o	Calls another functions 

•	addContact:  
o	ask the user for the Contact info as per the structure 
o	save it into the file
o	add it into the Linked list.

•	retrieveContact:
o	ask the user for the specific input
o	go through the linked list and retrieve that specific contact info

•	deleteContact: 
o	ask the user for the specific input
o	go through the linked list and removes that specific contact info

•	loadContact:
o	read the whole file which has the data
•	writeToTheFIle:
o	when user select to save the changes then the file will overwrite with the new contacts details within the linked list.
•	readFromFile:
o	when the program starts it will read all the data from the file and print it.

Reason/Advantages for Choosing the data structure:
-	Data structure will help to save info of the contact like name, number, group etc.
-	LinkedList: to link all that data structure in sequence and help do delete specific and retrieve specific data
